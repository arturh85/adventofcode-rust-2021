//! [Day 13: Transparent Origami](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/13)
//!
//! You reach another volcanically active part of the cave. It would be nice if you could do some
//! kind of thermal imaging so you could tell ahead of time which caves are too hot to safely enter.
//!
//! Fortunately, the submarine seems to be equipped with a thermal camera!
//! When you activate it, you are greeted with:
//!
//! ```plain
//! Congratulations on your purchase! To activate this infrared thermal imaging
//! camera system, please enter the code found on page 1 of the manual.
//! ```
//!
//! Apparently, the Elves have never used this feature. To your surprise, you manage to find the manual; as you go to open it, page 1 falls out. It's a large sheet of [transparent paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(projection))! The transparent paper is marked with random dots and includes instructions on how to fold it up (your puzzle input). For example:
//!
//! ```plain
//! 6,10
//! 0,14
//! 9,10
//! 0,3
//! 10,4
//! 4,11
//! 6,0
//! 6,12
//! 4,1
//! 0,13
//! 10,12
//! 3,4
//! 3,0
//! 8,4
//! 1,10
//! 2,14
//! 8,10
//! 9,0
//!
//! fold along y=7
//! fold along x=5
//! ```
//!
//! The first section is a list of dots on the transparent paper. `0,0` represents the top-left
//! coordinate. The first value, `x`, increases to the right. The second value, `y`, increases
//! downward. So, the coordinate `3,0` is to the right of `0,0`, and the coordinate `0,7` is
//! below `0,0`. The coordinates in this example form the following pattern, where `#` is a dot
//! on the paper and `.` is an empty, unmarked position:
//!
//! ```plain
//! ...#..#..#.
//! ....#......
//! ...........
//! #..........
//! ...#....#.#
//! ...........
//! ...........
//! ...........
//! ...........
//! ...........
//! .#....#.##.
//! ....#......
//! ......#...#
//! #..........
//! #.#........
//! ```
//!
//! Then, there is a list of fold instructions. Each instruction indicates a line on the
//! transparent paper and wants you to fold the paper up (for horizontal `y=...` lines) or
//! left (for vertical `x=...` lines). In this example, the first fold instruction
//! is `fold along y=7`, which designates the line formed by all of the positions where
//! `y` is `7` (marked here with `-`):
//!
//! ```plain
//! ...#..#..#.
//! ....#......
//! ...........
//! #..........
//! ...#....#.#
//! ...........
//! ...........
//! -----------
//! ...........
//! ...........
//! .#....#.##.
//! ....#......
//! ......#...#
//! #..........
//! #.#........
//! ```
//!
//! Because this is a horizontal line, fold the bottom half up. Some of the dots might end up
//! overlapping after the fold is complete, but dots will never appear exactly on a fold line.
//! The result of doing this fold looks like this:
//!
//! ```plain
//! #.##..#..#.
//! #...#......
//! ......#...#
//! #...#......
//! .#.#..#.###
//! ...........
//! ...........
//! ```
//!
//! Now, only `17` dots are visible.
//!
//! Notice, for example, the two dots in the bottom left corner before the transparent
//! paper is folded; after the fold is complete, those dots appear in the top left corner
//! (at `0,0` and `0,1`). Because the paper is transparent, the dot just below them in the
//! result (at `0,3`) remains visible, as it can be seen through the transparent paper.
//!
//! Also notice that some dots can end up overlapping; in this case, the dots merge together and
//! become a single dot.
//!
//! The second fold instruction is `fold along x=5`, which indicates this line:
//!
//! ```plain
//! #.##.|#..#.
//! #...#|.....
//! .....|#...#
//! #...#|.....
//! .#.#.|#.###
//! .....|.....
//! .....|.....
//! ```
//!
//! Because this is a vertical line, fold left:
//!
//! ```plain
//! #####
//! #...#
//! #...#
//! #...#
//! #####
//! .....
//! .....
//! ```
//!
//! The instructions made a square!
//!
//! The transparent paper is pretty big, so for now, focus on just completing the first fold.
//! After the first fold in the example above, `17` dots are visible - dots that end up overlapping
//! after the fold is completed count as a single dot.
//!
//! **How many dots are visible after completing just the first fold instruction on
//! your transparent paper?**
//!
//! # Part Two
//!
//! Finish folding the transparent paper according to the instructions.
//! The manual says the code is always eight capital letters.
//!
//! **What code do you use to activate the infrared thermal imaging camera system?**
